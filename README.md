**Develop and deploy scalable applications using micro frontend strategies**

## What is this book about?
Although deservedly popular and highly performant tools for building modern web applications, React and single-page applications (SPAs) become more and more sluggish as your applications and teams grow. To solve this problem, many large web apps have started to break down monolith SPAs into independently deployable smaller apps and componentsâ€”a pattern called micro frontends. But micro frontends aren't a perfect solution, but rather a double-edged sword. This book teaches you how to architect and build them with the right principles to reap all the benefits without the pitfalls.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover two primary patterns for building micro frontends
* Explore how to set up monorepos for efficient team collaboration
* Deal with complexities such as routing and sharing state between different micro frontends
* Understand how module federation works and use it to build micro frontends
* Find out how to deploy micro frontends to cloud platforms
* Figure out how to build the right development experience for teams
